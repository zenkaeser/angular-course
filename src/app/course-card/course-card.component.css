/* these styles are only specific to this component and does not affect the rest of the application
   this feature is called 'View Encapsulation' - styles are encapsulated and only visible on a particular component view. */

/* Angular when its instantiating our view is adding to every element this special attribute [_ngcontent-c0]
   which is unique to this component. Each component will have a unique style identifier */

/* Each component will have a different sequential number that is going to be used to produce this special attribute
   that is then going to be applied to every element of the template */

/* Its this special content attributes that are going to enable the default view encapsulation mechanism */

/* The elements projected with <NG-CONTENT> are going to get stamped by the identifier of the component from where they were created*/
